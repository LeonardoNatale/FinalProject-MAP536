# TO DO

- Track the evolution of our RMSE
- Adjust Date features (day, week, month, weekday)
- Calculate the distance to the closest holiday
- Interaction between monthly passengers and day of the month
- Pass a multimodel directly to gridsearch. [Link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html)
- Try TimeSeries
- Try AdaBoost
- Do we need a function to return the model name lowercase?
- Do we want to scale and use a column transformer?
- Make classes more Pythonese. Adding decorator @property and fixing the setters
